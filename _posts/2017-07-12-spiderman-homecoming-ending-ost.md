Our friendly neighborhood Spiderman has returned to become teenager

Ending OST of Spiderman homecoming is "Blitzkrieg Bop" by American punk rock group Ramones.

The song is perfect selection to the movie, youthful and energetic.

Personally, This is only song I could remember after watching movie(except the original Spiderman song at Marvel opening scene)
